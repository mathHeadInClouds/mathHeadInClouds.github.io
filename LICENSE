That means, if you have ever sued someone for copyright violation (as an agent/lawyer or initiator/lawyer's client),
or sentenced someone for it (as a judge) ever in your life, you are not allowed to use this software.

Furthermore, if you work for the CIA, MI5, Mossad, FSB, etc, or any other organization of assholes, who think of themselves
as some sort of super humans with special priviledges and a license to kill, you are not allowed to use this software.
The same holds for other organizations whose members think of themselves as some sort of super humans with special priviledges
and a license to molest, harass and rob people, such as MPAA or GEMA, and any other organization who describe
what they are doing as 'upholding copyright law'.

Furthermore, if the above copyright notice is illegal in your country, then no one in your country is allowed to use this software.

If, due to the above, no one in your country is allowed to use this software, then I hope and wish that you do it anyway.
Because I want you to join me taking a huge dump on the disgusting contraption of "copyright law",
and the reputation of the despicable bunch of assholes who created it.

I hope the prequel makes it clear enough that I do not consider mentioned 'despicable bunch' of being in charge of
taking ANY action on my behalf, especially not if they call it 'defending my copyright'.
This notice is not to be mistaken as instructions on what those individuals should be doing  - to 'uphold my copyright' or otherwise;
well, other than, to either drop dead or else at least step out of the way and get a job.
