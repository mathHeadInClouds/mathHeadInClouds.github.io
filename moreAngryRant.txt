And if the feature does/would possibilitate the authorship of "unsavory" code? Then what? What of it? WHAT OF IT??!
If all such features were removed from JavaScript, then JavaScript would mutate into a "1001 training wheels language",
a language for uncreative dimwits. What would be so great about having one more of those? We already have JAVA, I think
that's sufficient. If "training wheels" are so dear to you, please go play with your marbles, bye.
