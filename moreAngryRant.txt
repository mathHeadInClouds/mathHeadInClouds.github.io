And if the feature does/would possibilitate the authorship of "unsavory" code? Then what? What of it? WHAT OF IT??!
If all such features were removed from JavaScript, then JavaScript would mutate into a "1001 training wheels language",
a language for uncreative dimwits. What would be so great about having one more of those? We already have JAVA, I think
that's sufficient. If "training wheels" are so dear to you, please go play with your marbles, write your JAVA code,
leave us adults alone, and most importantly, keep your nanny finger up your own nose.
