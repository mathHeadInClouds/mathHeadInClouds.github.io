If you find language design debates tiresome, you are preaching to the choir. Every programming language which is any good (also, every opera, symphony, or movie script which is any good) has been created by one person alone, not a committee. Thinking about a hypothetical language coming out of stack overflow users, as a committe, designing it, via election or some other "community process" - just thinking about that makes me shiver. Describing just how much that language would stink would be hate speech.

If you have strong opinions on how a language should be designed, then design one. Do that, or let it be. Don't try designing one by building a commitee and showering the world with harange. The people who want to use SO as a language design forum probably consist, to some percentage, of people who don't understand just how annoying that kind of harange is. And that percentage I determined (using my superior math skills and refined calculations) to be: just below 101%.

If I live long enough, I want to design my own language one day, and that is hard. So I'm starting with a transpiler. What's wrong with it if I try to make my first transpiler useful for people other than me. Does that turn me into a one of those "sowjets" described in the last paragraph? I hope not.

Please don't force "language design philosopy discussion" onto me. And while I let SO parttake in me trying to master my first transpiler, if then, while I talk about technicalities, my own "language design philosophical viewpoint" (I obviously have one) should "spill out", please don't conclude that I'm "on a language feature crusade". If I am, then I truely don't know myself, because in how I see myself, that is the very last thing I want. Being accused to be someone who does the equivalent of calling up Richard Strauss to tell him how to compose - (which is what "opinion based question" or "off topic" amounts to) - if you think you ought to put me through that, I hope have thought that through.
