To whom it may concern,

(I know stack overflow is not a person, but - in grammar - I'm going to assume that.)

Dear stack overflow,

I want a "divorce". I'm sure you have procedures you put in place when a member has died.
Those probably are: Make it impossible to login as that member, but keep the data, and
don't reset the username to "available".

I propose to you put these procedures into place. Please pretend that I died.

It is certain that I will not be willing to provide new content for/ to you, I have no
issues with your continued use of the existing content, and I just want to leave without
any additional "yelling".

A respectful "agree to disagree"
