<h3>stack overflow vs. wikipedia - motivations, philosophies - a comparison</h3>	

<p>The way to differenciate a "community" from a mere "group of people", is to observe the words
group members use when they talk about the group. If "we" is used, it is a community; otherwise,
it's just a group of people.</p>

<p>In that sense, I came to the realization: There is a "stack overflow community", and I am not
a member of it. Because, I would never use the word "we" with regard to that community.
If that was 99% clear to me before my first meta question <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/392505/ask-for-post-author-approval-of-edits-even-when-one-has-full-edit-privileges">(this one)</a> - now it is 100%.
In the unlikely case that one day, I'll have 5 digit or 6 digit reputation, I'll still
not be a member - I will not say "we". That is the realization, and I'm fine with it.
Not everybody has to be a member of all communities.</p>

<p>While not being a member, I look forward to continue my guest status. I will continue to write
questions, answers, and comments. And I will continue to not edit other people's posts. No, not
because I'm a spoiled brat who didn't get his button and now is moping; No, the button would not
have "helped". It's just one of those things I leave to the people who say "we", button or not.</p>

<p>Since years, I'm planning to write an article about what it is that makes me love stackoverflow
as much as I do, and makes me spend as much time contributing as I do; while a deeply detest
wikipedia, and certainly will never contribute a single byte there.</p>

<p>I haven't written it yet (or is this it??), but I can summarize what it will say, using
star treck methaphors. To me, the stackoverflow community is like those "liquid people".
While wikipedia is "the borg".</p>

<p>I enjoy interacting with "the liquid people", while not being one of them, while with "the borg",
my sole desire is to be as far away as possible from them.</p>

<p>It all has to do with property rights, which, apparently, is a very touchy subject. In SO, to a large
extent, what motivates people (for example, me) to contribute, is a healthy and honest relationship
to one's long term self interest. The motivation to act according to group interest works very much in
a similar way as it does with ebay customer satisfaction percentage. Reputation is the mechanism
aligning group interest and self interest. You attract the new ebay customer your self interest desires,
because you did not defraud the previous ones (according to the reputation), just as people read your SO
posts because they appear more on top (according to upvotes) which aligns with your self interest (of more
'honor' and/or, getting a job at some point). It works, and is rooted in property rights - which work
since millions of years - they predate humanity, a version of them is present in the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>In stark contrast wikipedia is cult which denies healthy self interest on the deepest possible level (identity).
You are not authoring articles, the hive mind is; and you as an individual don't even exist -
that is the self image wikipedia promotes.</p>

<p>SO is not closed to the "altruistic" mode of motivation. But it is not the main thing, it's a "side kick";
it's, if you will, something like "the Sabbath". It's just one of 7 days. The day you won't see me.</p>

<p>SO is a giant collection of art galleries. That you can "add a mustache to the Mona Lisa" is not a violation
of property rights, because it's all data, and you only add, you never delete other people's work, the
old version is always easy to restore.
And although you can add the mustache, and walk right in, everybody knows, this is -kind of- someone's
living room (on everybody party day), and you have to show respect.</p>

<p>In stark contrast, a wikipedia article is a public toilet.</p>

<p>I feel the need to invent a god - just so that I can pray to him that the hive mind not invade SO.
And turn open art galleries into toilets.</p>

<p>In that regard, I'm very optimisitic. Absurdly, people seem to preach "public toilet" and act "respect for
other people's living room"; and the actions are what counts, and thus my optimism. The "pro toilet"
attitudes are only lip service on the very very surface, because that "philosophy" is on sale 24-7-365,
being an integral part of the business model of the mafia-which-is-not-called-mafia (hint: starts with 'g').
That's just the usual yada-yada, those are not deeply held convictions. We'd all be in very very deep
sh*t if it were otherwise.</p>
