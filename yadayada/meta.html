I hereby retract the feature request.

Despite all your comments which are full of wrong reasons and things unrelated to the button with which I disagree.

If the author of a post wants the post to be non-editable, they can easily do that simply by putting
the post (or a portion of it) on their own website (((like this)))

By not doing that, the author has (implicitely) agreed to whatever editing is customary on SO.

It's of course a little more work to put the post (or part of it) onto an external source, but that is
exactly "how it should be": if you spent a lot of work to make the perfect post, the little extra work of
putting it somewhere external in order to protect it from doofus-improvements won't make much of a difference
in terms of total work spent; and if you didn't spend a lot of work, chances are, it is not the perfect post,
and it is a good thing that it will be edited, maybe even by some semi-doofus.

It is pityful that the majority of comments (actually, all of them except ..) treated the button as a side issue and focussed on pesky nagging 
about maximally opinion based issues. In terms of that stuff, my "philosophy" (which shouldn't have been the center of the discussion) has
not changed a millimeter.
