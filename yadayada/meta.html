I hereby retract the feature request.

Not *because* but *despite* all your comments -which are full of wrong reasons, pitiful nagging, and walmart bargain bin philosophy-
I had an insight into why indeed such a button is totally superfluous.

If the author of a post wants the post to be non-editable, they can easily do that simply by putting
the post (or a portion of it) on their own website (((like this)))

By not doing that, the author has (implicitely) agreed to whatever editing is customary on SO.

It's of course a little more work to put the post (or part of it) onto an external source, but that is
exactly "how it should be": if you spent a lot of work to make the perfect post, the little extra work of
putting it somewhere external in order to protect it from doofus-improvements won't make much of a difference
in terms of total work spent; and if you didn't spend a lot of work, chances are, it is not the perfect post,
and it is a good thing that it will be edited, maybe even by some semi-doofus.
