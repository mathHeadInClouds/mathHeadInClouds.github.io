I thought about it, and came to the conclusion that indeed, the button is completely unnecessary.
But not for any of the reasons mentioned in the comments or answer(s).

If the author of a post wants the post to be non-editable, they can easily do that simply by putting
the post (or a portion of it) on their own website (((like this)))

By not doing that, the author has (implicitely) agreed to whatever editing is customary on SO.

It's of course a little more work to put the post (or part of it) onto an external source, but that is
exactly "how it should be": if you spent a lot of work to make the perfect post, the little extra work of
putting it somewhere external in order to protect it from doofus-improvements won't make much of a difference;
and if you didn't spend a lot of work, chances are, it is not the perfect post, and it is a good thing
that it is edited, maybe even by some semi-doofus.

There you go. You convinced me. No, you didn't. I changed my mind despite the large collection
of bogus non-reasons why the button is not needed.
